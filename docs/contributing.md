### How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch for your contributions. Please use descriptive and concise branch names.
2. Make your desired changes or additions to the codebase.
3. Ensure that your code adheres to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) coding style guidelines.
4. Write appropriate tests for your changes, ensuring that they pass.
    - `make test`
5. Update the documentation and examples, if necessary.
6. Build the html documentation and verify if it works as expected. We have used Sphinx for documentation, you could build the documents as follows:

8. Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
9. Submit a pull request from your branch to the development branch of the original repository.
10. Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request. Address any feedback or comments if required.
11. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main codebase.
